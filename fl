# NAME
#	fl - for each line
#	<http://freshmeat.net/projects/ff/>
#
# SYNOPSIS
#	fl [-eh] file1 file2 ... [ < script ]
#
# OPTIONS
#	-e	Use a custom ${EDITOR} for entering scripting commands.
#		This option _may_ disable the ability to pipe or redirect data 
#		to this tool; check with your text editor.
#
#	-h	Display this help message.
#
# ARGUMENTS
#	file	Path to a file (non-directory).
#
#	script	Path to an existing script file (non-directory).
#
# DESCRIPTION
#	Allows the user to execute a Bash script for each line in the specified
#	files. The script given by the user is interpreted directly by the BASH
#	shell.
#
#	If you wish to invoke an existing script, you can do so via piping or 
#	redirection. For example, to run a script named 'my_script' upon a 
#	file 'my_file', you would run the following.
#
#		Method 1: 	fl my_file < my_script
#		
#		Method 2:	cat my_script | fl my_file
#
#	Notice that the '-e' option is not present. Depending on how your text
#	editor handles I/O redirection, omitting '-e' may allow you to pipe or
#	redirect input to this tool.
#
#	When an existing script is not invoked, the user will be prompted to
#	type in scripting commands in the terminal.
#	
#	If you wish enter scripting commands using your favorite text editor,
#	set a global shell variable ${EDITOR} to its path. For example, if your
#	text editor was located at '/foo/bar', you would run the following.
#	
#		declare -x EDITOR=/foo/bar
#
#
# SCRIPT VARIABLES
#	The following variables are available for use in users' scripts.
#
#	$f	basename of current file (non-directory)
#	$d	path of current working directory
#	$p	path of current file (non-directory)
#	$n	total number of lines in current file (non-directory)
#	$i	number of current line
#	$l	contents of current line
