		<h2>Questions and Answers</h2>
		<ol>
			<li id="find_exec">
				<h3>What are the advantages of using <b>For each File</b> instead of <samp>find -exec</samp>?</h3>
				<blockquote>
					<p><b>For each File</b> is more efficient than using <samp>find -exec</samp> in conjunction with an intermediate shell (e.g., <code>find . -exec bash -c '...' \;</code>). For every file it handles, <samp>find -exec</samp> forks a child process for the intermediate shell; thus causing the operating system to perform a context switch. In contrast, <b>For each File</b> invokes a <samp>GNU BASH</samp> function, which is already present in memory; thus avoiding a context switch. This behavior reduces the number of process forks, which are generally more resource expensive than function calls.</p>

					<p>Note that the use of <samp>find -exec</samp> in conjunction with an intermediate shell is quite common in solutions to non-trivial problems that employ these tools.</p>

			<li id="read_ignored">
				<h3>Why is the <samp>read</samp> built-in command in my script being ignored?</h3>
				<blockquote>
					<p>By default, the <samp>read</samp> built-in command attempts to read user input from the standard input stream. However, the standard input stream may be in use if this tool is invoked with the <samp>--pipe</samp> option.</p>

					<p>If your intention is to read input from the user, a solution is to have the <samp>read</samp> built-in command read directly from the user's terminal rather than the standard input stream: <code>read &lt; /dev/tty</code></p>

			</li>

			<li id="shell_arg_buffer">
				<h3>Why does the tool crash when a large number of targets are specified on the command-line?</h3>
				<blockquote>
					<p>The number of targets specified may be too large for the <samp>execle</samp> system call to handle. A solution is to pipe the large list of targets to the tool whilst invoking it with the <samp>--pipe</samp> option. Another solution is to use the recursive mode of this tool to traverse a directory which contains, either physically or indirectly via symbolic or hard links, the large number of targets.</p>

			<li id="targets_garbled">
				<h3>Why are some targets given on the command-line handled improperly?</h3>
				<blockquote>
					<p>The names of these targets may contain characters that are being misinterpreted by the tool or the shell. A solution is to precede the list of targets by the <samp>--</samp> option. This signals the command-line options parser to stop parsing the remaining targets. A more fault-tolerant solution is to feed a list of the target names to the tool whilst invoking it with the <samp>--pipe</samp> option. This ensures that target names bypass the scrutiny of both the shell and tool, thus avoiding misinterpretation.</p>
