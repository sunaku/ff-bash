  1. What's the advantage of using this instead of find -exec?

    In comparison to using 'find -exec', key advantages are:
    - better performance (less system resources used)
    - flexibility (user can perform tasks without a separate script)
    - simplicity (saves time and effort)

    In order to justify these claims, consider the following cases.

    (1) Case 1: Executing an existing script.

        For every file it handles, 'find -exec' forks a separate
        child-process to execute the user's commands. On a large input
        size, this behavior yields poor performance.

        This tool uses less system resources, and thereby yields better
        performance, by employing only one Bash process (in both
        non/recursive modes). Separate child-processes are not forked
        because user commands are evaluated by the same Bash process.

        This tool also provides preset scripting variables to save
        users' time. Although it is a trivial matter to assemble these
        variables within a script, it becomes wasteful and tedious for
        quick tasks.


    (2) Case 2: Performing complex tasks at the terminal without the use of
        a separate script.

        As the complexity of the problem increases, using 'find -exec'
        to implement solutions at the terminal becomes cryptic and time
        consuming. One possibility is to write a separate script and use
        it with 'find -exec'. In which case, this tool already puts the
        power of the Bash shell at the user's disposal, without having
        to manually create a separate script each time.

        Using this tool, the user can, but is not forced to, enter
        scripting commands on one line. Entering commands is often made
        more efficient when this tool is launched with the editor
        option. This option allows the user to enter scripting commands
        via their favorite text editor, rather than fiddling with a
        one-line script at the terminal.

        Consider the following examples.

        (2a) Example A: We wish to extract all tar-ball files in the
             current working directory.

            $ ls
            bar.tgz  foo.tgz

            (2a-1) Using this tool:

                $ ff *tgz
                tar -zxf "$f"

            (2a-2) Using 'find -exec':

                $ find . -name '*tgz' -exec tar -zxf '{}' ';'

        (2b) Example B: We wish to rename the file extension 'tgz' to
             'tar.gz' and display the original filename.

            $ ls some_tgz/tgz_dir/
            bar.tgz  b a z.tgz  foo.tgz

            (2b-1) Using this tool:

                $ ff some_tgz/tgz_dir/*tgz
                mv "$f" "$d/${fn/%tgz/tar.gz}"
                echo $fn

            (2b-2) Using 'find -exec':

                $ find some_tgz/tgz_dir/ -name '*tgz' -exec sh -c 'mv "{}" `dirname "{}"`/`basename "{}" | sed "s/tgz/tar.gz/"`; echo {}' \;

            Notice that we invoked a shell with 'find -exec' for this task.
            It is possible to perform the task without the aid of an
            intermediate shell, but one can imagine how time consuming and
            error prone that would be.


    In conclusion, this tool gives the user flexibility while saving them
    time and maintaining low usage of system resources.
