			<li id="find_exec">
				<h3>What are the advantages of using <b>For each File</b> instead of <samp>find -exec</samp>?</h3>
				<blockquote>
					<p>
						There is one advantage, which can be observed under the following conditions. If <samp>find -exec</samp> is used to invoke an intermediate shell: <code>$ find . -exec sh -c '...' \;</code>, then it will expend more system resources than <b>For each File</b>. This is because, for each file it handles, <samp>find -exec</samp> will fork a child process (the intermediate shell) and thereby cause the operating system to perform a context switch. In contrast, <b>For each File</b> will invoke a <samp>GNU BASH</samp> function that is already loaded into memory and thus does not cause a context switch. This behavior reduces the number of process forks and thereby expends less system resources as compared to <samp>find -exec</samp> under said conditions.

			<li id="read_ignored">
				<h3>Why is the <samp>read</samp> built-in command in my script being ignored?</h3>
				<blockquote>
					<p>By default, the <samp>read</samp> built-in command attempts to read user input from the standard input stream. However, the standard input stream may be in use if this tool is invoked with the <samp>--pipe</samp> option.</p>
					
					<p>If your intention is to read input from the user, a solution is to have the <samp>read</samp> built-in command read directly from the user's terminal rather than the standard input stream: <code>read &lt; /dev/tty</code></p>

			<li id="shell_arg_buffer">
				<h3>Why does the tool crash when a large number of targets are specified on the command-line?</h3>
				<blockquote>
					<p>The <samp>GNU BASH</samp> shell employs a buffer, of finite capacity, in which it stores command-line arguments. When this buffer is filled beyond its capacity by a user's command, the user's command may crash. A solution is to pipe the large list of targets to the tool whilst invoking it with the <samp>--pipe</samp> option.</p>

			<li id="targets_garbled">
				<h3>Why are some targets given on the command-line handled improperly?</h3>
				<blockquote>
					<p>The names of these targets may contain characters that are being misinterpreted by the tool or the shell. A solution is to feed a list of the target names to the tool whilst invoking it with the <samp>--pipe</samp> option. This ensures that target names bypass the scrutiny of both the shell and tool, thus avoiding misinterpretation.</p>
