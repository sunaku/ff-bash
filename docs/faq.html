ANSWERS

1. What's the advantage of using this instead of 'find -exec'?

	In comparison to using 'find -exec', key advantages are:
	+ better performance (less system resources used)
	+ flexibility (user can perform tasks without a separate script)
	+ simplicity (saves time and effort)

	In order to justify these claims, consider the following cases.

	(1) Case 1: Executing an existing script.

		For every file it handles, 'find -exec' forks a separate child-process to execute the user's commands. On a large input size, this behavior yields poor performance. In contrast, this tool employs only one BASH process (in both non/recursive modes) to execute the user's commands. Thus it uses less system resources and yields better performance.

		This tool also provides preset variables for use in users' shell commands. Although it is a trivial matter to assemble these variables within a script, it often becomes tedious for quick tasks.


	(2) Case 2: Performing complex tasks at the terminal without the use of a separate script.

		Consider the following examples.

		(2a) Example A: We wish to extract all tar-ball files in the current working directory.

			$ ls -1
			bar.tgz
			foo.tgz

			(2a-1) Using this tool:

				$ ff *tgz -e 'tar -zxf "$f"'
				
			(2a-2) Using 'find -exec':

				$ find . -name '*tgz' -exec tar -zxf '{}' ';'

		(2b) Example B: We wish to rename the file extension 'tgz' to 'tar.gz' and display the original filename.

			$ ls -1 some_tgz/tgz_dir/
			bar.tgz
			b a z.tgz
			foo.tgz

			(2b-1) Using this tool:

				$ ff some_tgz/tgz_dir/*tgz -e 'mv "$f" "$d/${fn/%tgz/tar.gz}"; echo $fn'
				
			(2b-2) Using 'find -exec':

				$ find some_tgz/tgz_dir/ -name '*tgz' -exec sh -c 'mv "{}" `dirname "{}"`/`basename "{}" | sed "s/tgz/tar.gz/"`; `basename "{}"`' \;

	Notice that we invoked a shell with 'find -exec' for this task. It is possible to perform the task without the aid of an intermediate shell, but one can imagine how time consuming that would be.
	
	In conclusion, this simply allows for a different kind of approach to perform filesystem tasks. It is not meant to replace any UNIX tools such as 'find'.



2. How can I use the results of 'find' with this tool?

	Write the results of 'find' to a file and invoke this tool with the '--pipe' option. For example, consider recursively printing the basename of all
	.c files in the current working directory:
	
		$ find -name '*.c' | ff -pe 'echo $fn'



4. Why is the 'read' in my script being ignored?

	The BASH 'read' builtin expects to read user input from the standard input stream. However, the standard input stream may sometimes be in use by the '--pipe' option. To get around this, you can have the 'read' builtin read from the user's terminal:
	
		read < /dev/tty
