		<ul>
			<li>The start-up time has been made the same for all language codes.</li>
			<li>Command-line arguments can now be passed to a user's script via the <samp>--args</samp> option.</li>
			<li><samp>id3tag.lib</samp>, a library for reading ID3v1 and ID3v1.1 tags, has been added.
				<ul>
					<li><samp>ff.mp3_catalog</samp> now uses the new <samp>id3tag.lib</samp> library instead of the <samp>mp3info</samp> program, and the new <samp>--args</samp> option instead of querying the user.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>The short options <samp>-h</samp> and <samp>-v</samp> have been removed as their longer counterparts are more common.</li>
			<li>The language code can now be specified via the <samp>--lang</samp> option.</li>
