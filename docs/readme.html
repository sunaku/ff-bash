LIMITATIONS

	* Multi-byte characters may not displayed properly in documentation because the 'read' builtin may strip them out depending upon your locale. You can try setting LC_ALL to the value "C" (shown below), and try viewing the documentation again.
	
		$ declare -x LC_ALL=C

DOCUMENTATION

	1. View help message, optionally translated into the language specified by an ISO-639 language code, for "For each File" by executing:

		./ff --help [ISO-639 language code]

	2. View help message, optionally translated into the language specified by an ISO-639 language code, for "For each Line" by executing:

		./fl --help [ISO-639 language code]

INSTALLATION

	Run the installation script by executing:
	
		./install

	Or perform a manual installation as follows:
	
		Simply move or copy the directory that contains this document to a location of your choice.
		
		For easy access, you can create symbolic links, to the tools in this package, in a directory that is listed in your $PATH variable (for example: "$HOME/bin/").

TRANSLATION

	Translation for documentation is performed dynamically through the use of gettext translation catalogs. These files are located in the "i18n/" directory.
	
	Feel free to contribute localizations for new languages and revise the existing translation catalogs.
	
	New and updated translation catalogs will be made available, as they are contributed, at this URL: <http://people.ucsc.edu/~skurapat/pub/projects/ff/i18n/>.
	
	To write translations for a new language, copy the appropriate *.pot file located in i18n/ to *.${ISO_639_CODE}.po. ${ISO_639_CODE} is language code defined in the ISO-639 standard.
	
		Example: We wish to create a translation for the language whose ISO-639 code is "XX". (1) we copy the template file, and (2) we fill in the translations in the copy.
	
		(1) $ cp catalog.pot catalog.XX.po

		(2) Before editing:
		
				msgid "A message in English."
				msgstr ""
			
			After editing:
			
				msgid "A message in English."
				msgstr "Your translation is placed here."
				
	Also note that you can use UNICODE characters (UTF-8) in the translation catalogs. However, as of this version, some of these characters may not be displayed properly (see the LIMITATIONS section).

EXAMPLES

	First try out the examples named 'ff.vars' and 'fl.vars', to see how the preset variables behave. Notice how the preset variables are consistent between recursive and non-recursive modes.

		./ff * -f./scripts/ff.vars | less
		./ff . -rf ./scripts/ff.vars | less

		./ff /bin/* -f ./scripts/ff.vars | less
		./ff /bin/ -rf ./scripts/ff.vars | less

		./fl ./COPYING -f ./scripts/fl.vars | less

	You can also try out the other example scripts in the scripts/ directory. Also, the first few lines of each script file describes its purpose, thus you can execute the following to see these descriptions:
	
		head ./scripts/* | less
