LIMITATIONS

	* Leading and trailing whitespace is automatically removed from lines when using 'fl'. This is because 'fl' uses the 'read' builtin to fetch lines of text from files.

	* Multi-byte characters are, as of this version, not displayed properly in documentation because the 'read' builtin strips them out.

DOCUMENTATION

	1. View help message, optionally translated into the language specified by an ISO-639 language code, for "For each File" by executing:

		./ff --help [ISO-639 language code]

	2. View help message, optionally translated into the language specified by an ISO-639 language code, for "For each Line" by executing:

		./fl --help [ISO-639 language code]

INSTALLATION

	Run the installation script by executing:
		./install

	Or perform a manual installation as follows:
	
		Move this directory to a location of your choice. Then create symbolic links to the files named 'ff' and 'fl' in a directory that is listed in your $PATH variable (for example: "$HOME/bin/").

TRANSLATION

	Translation for documentation is performed dynamically through the use of gettext translation catalogs. These files are located in the "i18n/" directory.
	
	Feel free to contribute localizations for new languages and revise the existing translation catalogs.
	
	New and updated translation catalogs will be made available, as they are contributed, at this URL: <http://people.ucsc.edu/~skurapat/pub/projects/ff/i18n/>.
	
	To write translations for a new language, copy the appropriate *.pot file located in i18n/ to *.${ISO_639_CODE}.po and write your translations like so:
	
		msgid "A message in English."
		msgstr "Un mensaje en Inglï¿½s."	<-- your translation
		
	${ISO_639_CODE} is language code defined in the ISO-639 standard. For example, the language code for Italian is 'it'.
	
	Also note that you can use UNICODE characters (UTF-8) in the translation catalogs. However, as of this version, some of these characters may not be displayed properly (see the LIMITATIONS section).

EXAMPLES

	First try out the examples named 'ff.vars' and 'fl.vars', to see how the preset variables behave.

	Try the following commands:

		./ff * -f./scripts/ff.vars | more
		./ff . -rf ./scripts/ff.vars | more

		./ff /bin/* -f ./scripts/ff.vars | more
		./ff /bin/ -rf ./scripts/ff.vars | more

		./fl COPYING -f ./scripts/fl.vars | more

	Notice that the scripting variables are consistent between recursive and non-recursive modes.

	You can also try out the other example scripts in the scripts/ directory. Also, the first few lines of each script file describes its purpose, thus you can execute the following to see these descriptions:
	
		head ./scripts/* | more
