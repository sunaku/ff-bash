INSTALLATION

	Run the installation script by executing:
	
		./install

	Or perform a manual installation as follows:
	
		Simply move or copy the directory containing this package to a location of your choice.
		
		For easy access, you can create symbolic links, to the tools in this package, in a directory that is listed in your $PATH variable (for example: "$HOME/bin/").

TRANSLATION

	Translation is performed dynamically through the use of gettext translation catalogs. These catalogs are located in the "i18n/" directory.
	
	Feel free to contribute localizations for new languages and revise the existing translation catalogs. New and updated translation catalogs will be made available, as they are contributed, at this URL: <http://people.ucsc.edu/~skurapat/pub/projects/ff/i18n/>.
	
	To write translations for a new language, copy the appropriate "*.pot" file located in "i18n/" to "*.${ISO_639_CODE}.po". ${ISO_639_CODE} is language code defined in the ISO-639 standard. Also note that you can use Unicode characters (UTF-8 and UTF-16) in the translation catalogs.
	
		Example: We wish to create a translation for the language whose ISO-639 code is "XX".
	
		(1) We make a copy of the template file.
		
			$ cp catalog.pot catalog.XX.po

		(2) We fill in the translations in the copy.
		
			msgid "Hello"           msgid "Hello"
			msgstr ""       -->     msgstr "Ciao"

EXAMPLES

	First try out (see example below) the scripts named 'ff.vars' and 'fl.vars', to see how the preset variables behave. Notice how the preset variables are consistent between recursive and non-recursive modes.

		./ff * -f./scripts/ff.vars | more
		./ff . -rf ./scripts/ff.vars | more

		./ff /bin/* -f ./scripts/ff.vars | more
		./ff /bin/ -rf ./scripts/ff.vars | more

		./fl ./COPYING -f ./scripts/fl.vars | more

	You can also try out the other example scripts in the scripts/ directory. Also, the first few lines of each script file describes its purpose, thus you can execute the following to see these descriptions:
	
		head ./scripts/* | more
