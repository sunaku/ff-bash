DESCRIPTION

	For each File (ff)
	
		Allows users to execute a Bash script recursively
		upon many files and directories. It is ideal for performing a
		repetitive procedure such as mass file renaming.


	For each Line (fl)
	
		Allows users to execute a Bash script once for each line in a
		file. It is ideal for performing complex text processing
		procedures.


FILES

	COPYING
	- A copy of the GNU GPL version 2 license.

	CHANGELOG
	- A list of important changes in this version.
	
	FAQ
	- Answers to frequently asked questions.

	install
	- Installation and uninstallation script.

	ff
	- For each File program.

	fl
	- For each Line program.

	ff-lib
	- Function library for programs in this package.

	examples/
	- Contains sample scripts to get you started.


LIMITATIONS

	- Leading and trailing whitespace is automatically removed from lines
	when using 'fl'. This is an unwanted side-effect of using the Bash
	builtin 'read' to fetch a line of text from a file.


DOCUMENTATION

	1. View help message for "For each File" by executing:

		./ff -h

	2. View help message for "For each Line" by executing:

		./fl -h

	3. Examine the source code of these programs (they are Bash scripts!).


INSTALLATION & REMOVAL

	To install, manually copy files in this directory or run:

		./install

	To remove, manually remove copied files or run:

		./install -u


EXAMPLES

	I recommend that you first execute the 'ff.vars' and 'fl.vars' examples
	to see how the scripting variables behave.

	Try the following commands:

		./ff * < ./examples/ff.vars | more
		./ff -r . < ./examples/ff.vars | more

		./ff /bin/* < ./examples/ff.vars | more
		./ff -r /bin/ < ./examples/ff.vars | more

		./fl README < ./examples/fl.vars | more

	Notice that the scripting variables are consistent between recursive and
	non-recursive modes.
