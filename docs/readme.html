PROGRAMS
	ff - "For each File"
	fl - "For each Line"


DESCRIPTION
	For each File allows users to execute a Bash script recursively upon
	many files and directories. It is ideal for performing a repetitive
	procedure such as mass file renaming.
	
	For each Line allows users to execute a Bash script, once for each line
	in many files.

DOCUMENTATION
	1. View help message for "For each File" by executing
	
		ff -h
	
	2. View help message for "For each Line" by executing:
	
		fl -h
	
	3. Examine source code.


INSTALLATION
	Run './install' or perform a manual installation as follows.

	1. Set the file permissions so that you can execute the programs.
	
		Example:	chmod u+x ff fl
	
	2. Copy the programs to a location recognized by your ${PATH} variable.
	
		Example:	cp ff fl ~/bin


EXAMPLES
	I recommend that you first execute the 'ff.vars' and 'fl.vars' examples
	to see how the scripting variables behave. Some examples have 'ready'
	flags which need to be set in order to make changes to files.
	
	Try the following commands.
	
		./ff * < ./examples/ff.vars
		./ff -r . < ./examples/ff.vars
		
		./ff /bin/* < ./examples/ff.vars
		./ff -r /bin/ < ./examples/ff.vars
		
		./fl README < ./examples/fl.vars
		
	Notice that the scripting variables are consistent between recursive and
	non-recursive modes. This behavior ensures consistent results from your
	scripts, independent of the mode and target files.
