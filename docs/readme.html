Description

  ff - For each File

      For each File allows users to execute a Bash script recursively upon
      many files and directories. It is ideal for performing a repetitive
      procedure such as mass file renaming.

  fl - For each Line

      Allows users to execute a Bash script once for each line in a file. It
      is ideal for performing complex text processing procedures.

Documentation

  1. View help message for "For each File" by executing:

      ./ff -h

  2. View help message for "For each Line" by executing:

      ./fl -h

  3. Examine the source code of these programs (they are Bash scripts!).



Installation

  Run the installation script './install', or perform a manual installation.


Examples

  I recommend that you first execute the 'ff.vars' and 'fl.vars' examples
  to see how the scripting variables behave.

  Try the following commands:

      ./ff * < ./examples/ff.vars | more
      ./ff -r . < ./examples/ff.vars | more

      ./ff /bin/* < ./examples/ff.vars | more
      ./ff -r /bin/ < ./examples/ff.vars | more

      ./fl README < ./examples/fl.vars | more

  Notice that the scripting variables are consistent between recursive and
  non-recursive modes.



Limitations

  * Leading whitespace is automatically stripped from lines when using 'fl'.
    This is an unwanted side-effect of using the Bash builtin 'read' to fetch a
    line of text from a file.
