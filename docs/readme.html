Description

  ff - For each File
  
  	For each File allows users to execute a Bash script recursively upon
  	many files and directories. It is ideal for performing a repetitive
  	procedure such as mass file renaming.
  
  fl - For each Line
  
  	Allows users to execute a Bash script once for each line in a file. It
  	is ideal for performing complex text processing procedures.

  	Example:	cp ff fl ~/bin


Examples

  I recommend that you first execute the 'ff.vars' and 'fl.vars' examples
  to see how the scripting variables behave. Some examples have 'ready'
  flags which need to be set in order to make changes to files.
  
  Try the following commands.
  
  	./ff * < ./examples/ff.vars
  	./ff -r . < ./examples/ff.vars
  	
  	./ff /bin/* < ./examples/ff.vars
  	./ff -r /bin/ < ./examples/ff.vars
  	
  	./fl README < ./examples/fl.vars
  	
  Notice that the scripting variables are consistent between recursive and
  non-recursive modes. This behavior ensures consistent results from your
  scripts, independent of the mode and target files.
