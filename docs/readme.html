PROGRAMS
	ff - "For each File"
	fl - "For each Line"

DESCRIPTION
	For each File allows users to execute a Bash script recursively upon
	many files and directories. It is ideal for performing a repetitive
	procedure such as mass file renaming.
	
	For each Line allows users to execute a Bash script, once for each line
	in many files.
