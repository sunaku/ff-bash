# NAME
#	ff - for each file
#
# SYNOPSIS
#	ff [-reh] target ...
#
# DESCRIPTION
#	Allows the user to write an embedded BASH script which will be executed
#	once for each of the specified files. This tool is ideal for performing 
#	a procedure upon a group of files or directories, such as mass re-naming
#	of files.
#
#	The procedure given by the user is interpreted directly by the BASH
#	shell. So you can think of this tool as a way to iteratively execute a 
#	BASH script upon a large number of files or directories.
#
#	If you wish to input your custom script using a text editor, set a 
#	global shell variable ${EDITOR} to the path of your favorite text 
#	editor. For example: `export EDITOR='path to editor'`.
#
#	If you wish to invoke an existing script, you can do so via piping or 
#	redirection. For example, to run a script named 'ff.script' upon a 
#	directory 'dir', you would run the following.
#
#		Method 1: 	ff -r dir < ff.script
#		Method 2:	cat ff.script | ff -r dir
#
#	Notice that the '-e' option is not present. Omitting '-e' allows you to
#	pipe or redirect input to 'ff'.
#
# PRESET VARIABLES
#	The following preset variables are available for use in users' scripts.
#	Note that the UNIX term 'file' refers to both files and directories.
#
#	$f	basename of current file (or directory)
#	$d	relative path to current working directory
#
# OPTIONS
#	-r	Apply to files and subdirectories recursively. Order of 
#		traversal is: sub-directories, and then files.
#
#	-e	Use a custom ${EDITOR} for entering scripting commands. 
#		This option disables the ability to pipe or redirect data 
#		to this tool.
#
#	-h	Display this help message.
